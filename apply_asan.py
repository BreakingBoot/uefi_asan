"""Apply this sanitizer to an arbitrary edk2 checkout.

  python3 uefi_asan/apply_asan.py --to <edk2 tree>

That is the whole of it for a normal run: point it at a checkout of whichever edk2 is
being tested and it works out the rest. --from names the tree the integration is taken
from and defaults to eval_source/edk2 beside this repository, --base the commit that
integration sits on top of.

The integration is 81 added files and 30 modified ones. The added files are self contained
and carry across untouched; the modified ones are edits to upstream code that moves, so
they are applied with a three way merge against whatever the target tree has, and then
repaired where upstream has moved out from under the merge. Every one of those repairs is
here because a version needed it and said something unhelpful when it did not get it --
"Macro or Environment has not been defined", "Unexpected the same FD name", "the required
fv image size exceeds the set fv image size" -- and none of them named the port.

What it reports is what matters. "Applied" is not the same as "instrumented": a merge can
succeed and leave the sanitizer switched off, which is the failure this whole pipeline is
worst at noticing. The caller should build and count __asan_load/__asan_store symbols
afterwards -- scripts/fuzz_edk2.py does, in its "instrumented" stage.

    A region in an FDF is an "offset|size" line and, under it, the PCD pair or FV it

    code -- and where the merge keeps both sides' offsets the result is two offset lines
    above one binding. The first is then a region with no type, and GenFds stops either
    at "A valid region type was not found" naming the binding, or at "The PCD should be
    FeatureFlag type or FixedAtBuild type" naming a PCD, neither of which mentions a
    region or a line that was kept by mistake.

    Which one to drop is not a guess: the resolver emits upstream's side first and the
    port's second, so the later line is the port's.

    This is deliberately a question about the finished file rather than about one
    conflict. Keying on what a region binds fails when the binding falls outside the
